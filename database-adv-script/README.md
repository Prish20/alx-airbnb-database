# Unleashing Advanced Querying Power - ALX Airbnb Database Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on advanced SQL querying techniques and optimization. The goal is to write efficient queries to manage data for an Airbnb-like application using PostgreSQL.

## Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins

### Objective (Task 0)

Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.

### Implemented Queries (Task 0)

1. **INNER JOIN**: List all bookings along with the users who made them.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: List all properties and their reviews, including properties without reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: List all users and all bookings, even if they are not linked.

### Results (Task 0)

* Queries executed successfully in PostgreSQL.
* Outputs verified and match expected results.

## Task 1: Subqueries Practice

### Objective (Task 1)

Write both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.

### Implemented Queries (Task 1)

1. **Non-Correlated Subquery**: Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0.
2. **Correlated Subquery**: Find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

### Results (Task 1)

* Queries executed successfully in PostgreSQL.
* Outputs verified and match expected results.

## Task 2: Aggregations and Window Functions

### Objective (Task 2)

Use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.

### Implemented Queries (Task 2)

1. **Aggregation:** Find the total number of bookings made by each user using COUNT and GROUP BY.
2. **Window Function:** Rank properties based on the total number of bookings using RANK().

### Results (Task 2)

* Queries executed successfully in PostgreSQL.
* Outputs verified and match expected results.
